# Ecommerce Cohort Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes customer behavior over a year periode using cohort analysis to understand retention patterns and revenue trends in an eCommerce business. By grouping customers based on their first purchase month, the analysis uncovers how long they stay active and how their value changes throughout their journey. The insights help identify opportunities to improve customer loyalty, plan targeted campaigns, and increase long-term revenue.

## Project Workflow

This project follows the steps below:
1. Importing Libraries: loading all necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering.
2. Data Preparation: loading the dataset.
3. Cohort Assignment: Group customers by their first purchase month to define cohort groups.
4. Retention Matrix: Build a matrix to visualize how many customers remain active in each month after joining.
5. Revenue by Cohort: Track total revenue generated by each cohort month-by-month.

## Insight
Most customers made a purchase in their first month, followed by a sharp drop in the following months. The January cohort had the highest number of new customers (215) and showed relatively strong retention up to month 8, with noticeable increases in months 6 and 8, possibly due to special promotions or campaigns. The March cohort showed stable retention up to month 6, suggesting that some customers can become loyal with the right strategy. However, long-term retention remains low, indicating that the company should improve its engagement efforts to retain customers for a longer period.

The January cohort had the highest revenue in month 1, but it dropped in the following months. However, revenue rose significantly in months 4, 7, and 12, possibly due to promotions or re-engagement efforts. The March cohort still generated moderate revenue until month 6, showing that customers stayed active for a short period. Other cohorts also showed a similar pattern, with some revenue increases in the last three months of their journey.

## Suggested Strategies
In the first month, when engagement is typically at peak, it’s important to launch strong onboarding campaigns. Personalized welcome emails, first-time buyer discounts, and product recommendations based on browsing behavior can help create a positive first impression and encourage repeat purchases early on. Between months 3 to 5, a noticeable drop in retention often occurs. This is an ideal window to implement win-back promotions aimed at reactivating customers who have become less engaged. Automated emails offering limited-time discounts, reminders for abandoned carts, or special “We Miss You” offers can help bring them back before they churn completely.

During seasonal peaks, especially in Q4 (October to December) brands can take advantage of higher shopping activity by running targeted campaigns. This includes exclusive seasonal sales, holiday bundles, or personalized gift guides. Aligning these campaigns with each cohort’s original purchase month ensures relevance and improves conversion rates. For customers who remain active beyond month 6, loyalty programs can play a crucial role in strengthening long-term relationships. Offering reward points, VIP perks, or early access to new products encourages consistent buying behavior and increases customer lifetime value. Recognizing long-term customers through exclusive offers or anniversary rewards also adds a personal touch that boosts loyalty.
